I had a python scraper project lying around from two years ago. 
So I thought it would be useful to be able to develop on an older version of python.

I originally had a 2.5GB zip file in this folder that I deleted since this has to be uploaded. But I utilzied .dockerignore to keep the local venv and that huge file out of the context. 
The docker-compose file mounts the current dir to /app.
